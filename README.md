# Smart-Outreach-Application-Case-Study-Project
As part of a team project under the ALX Foundation course, we designed and prototyped a Smart Outreach Application to support the placement of homeless individuals and improve access to healthcare and social services.
Problem Definition: Addressed key challenges in outreach and service delivery, including identifying homeless persons, placing them in nearby shelters, documenting their cases, and connecting them to essential social and healthcare services.
Market Analysis: Researched and calculated the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and Serviceable Available Market (SAM) to assess the solution’s scale and feasibility.
MVP Design: Created the concept and prototype for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) featuring real-time tracking, referral workflows, and structured documentation.
Pitch Development: Designed and delivered a compelling pitch highlighting the application’s impact, scalability, and value proposition.
